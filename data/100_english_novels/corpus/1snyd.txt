CLARA VAUGHAN
BOOK I.
CHAPTER I.
I do not mean to describe myself. Already I feel that the personal pronoun will appear too often in these pages. Knowing the faults of my character almost as well as my best friends know them, I shall attempt to hide them no more than would those beloved ones. Enough of this: the story I have to tell is strange, and short as my own its preamble.
The day when I was the I love all three of you, to-day, to-morrow, and for ever. Only don't  pull me to pieces."
THE END.
